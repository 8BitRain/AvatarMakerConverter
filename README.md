# AvatarMakerConverter
This tool reads information from .json files to construct an avatar. We will base the avatar on save data from player local storage.

We use base64 to pull images from spritesheets and print image data to the html canvas.

## Running the AvatarMakerConverter
Serve the index.html file with your tool of choice in the root folder. 

`python3 -m http.serve`
